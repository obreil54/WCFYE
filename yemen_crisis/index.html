    <h3 class="red-text">2. One million are living in unplanned camps</h3><br>
    <h3>One million displaced Yemenis are scattered across over 1,500 impromtu, unplanned camps and require support to met their basic needs.</h3><br><br>
    <h3 class="red-text">3. Eight out of ten live below the poverty line</h3><br>
    <h3>The economy and currency in Yemen have collapsed, and the situation has been exacerbated by the global Covid-19 turndown. As a result, millions of people cannot afford to make ends meet. Today 80% of people in Yemen live below the poverty line.</h3><br><br>
    <h3 class="red-text">4. 24.1 million people need humanitarian aid</h3><br>
    <h3>Over 12 million of these are estimated to be in acute need. The people are facing crisis and are struggling to obtain the basics needed to survive and maintain their health and wellbeing.</h3><br><br>
    <h3 class="red-text">5. Five million people are at risk of famine</h3><br>

    <h3>Just over two million school-age girls and boys are out of school. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, approximately 47% of girls were out of school compared to 53% of boys.

    <h3 class="red-text">10. Nine million people have had their food assistance halved</h3><br>
